Hi, I'm Sanuj Sharma. I recently graduated from [IIT - Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/) with a major in Electronics and Communication Engineering. As an undergraduate, I worked on computer vision, robotics and machine learning projects through opensource contributions and bachelor thesis project. During summers, I interned in Indian startups -- did some Android and web development.

I like to read -- sci-fi, non-fiction (biographies of scientists and entrepreneurs), research blogs and take online courses.
