Last year I worked on segmenting nuclei in histopathological images using deep learning which resulted in a publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.

For more details see -

* Link to the [paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByERBiBsEbuTOEJISEpwSkR0SlE) submitted to IEEE-TMI.
* A more detailed [blog post](https://surabhibhargava.github.io/2017/02/25/Detection-and-Segmentation-of-Nuclei-in-Computational-Pathology.html).

I also made a small presentation about it which can be viewed below.
